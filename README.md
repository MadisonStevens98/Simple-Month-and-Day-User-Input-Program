# Simple-Month-and-Day-User-Input-Program

Program takes an int (1-12) from the user for the month, and an int (1-31) for the day. The program will reject any month int not 1-12 and prompt user for a new input. For the day input, the program will not accept any invalid date (30th of February for example) and ask the user for new input. 

My first ever C++ program, and is thus an incredibly basic program.
